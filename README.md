# Epsilon-Free-FSA
This project is an adaptation of a code initally intended to use boolean matrix mutliplication to run FSAs. It still has that function, however it can make a non-detrministic FSA into an Epsison -Free FSA
This project does not use Pynini, and it does use NumPy
The presentation attached has been modified from one given in a mathematical methods course
